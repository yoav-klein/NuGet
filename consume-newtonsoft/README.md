# Consume Newtonsoft
---

Here we want to demonstrate consumption of the most popular NuGet package in nuget.org - Newtonsoft.Json.
The `using-dotnet-cli` is a `.NET 5` project. This means it's a SDK-style project. The reference to the package is in a `<PackageReference>` tag in the project file. The `restore` is done using the `dotnet.exe` CLI.
